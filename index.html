    The Pandas Challenge was part of the NU Data Analysis and Visualization Boot Camp. The goal was to pull insights out of a data set of customer purchases on a mobile platform.
  </p>
  <p>
    The following was demonstrated through the analysis:
    <ul>
    <li>-	Per gender demographics, there are significantly more male players than female players (84.03% versus 14.06%), and male players have made a significantly larger share of purchases than female players ($1,967.64 versus $361.94 ). However, female players have a higher average total purchase than male players ($4.47 versus $4.07). Might be worth trying to encourage a larger number of female players to join the game.</li>
    <li>-	Per age demographics, the largest age group in the player base is 20 - 24-year-olds (44.79%. This group is also the third highest average total purchase per person ($4.32). This shows that this age range is a good demographic to target.</li>
    <li>-	People are willing to pay a premium for some items. All five of both the top-selling items and the top-grossing items are above the average purchase price per item â€“ between $.17 and $1.56 more than the $3.05 average for top-selling, and between $1.18 and $1.85 more for top-grossing. However, the total of these purchases make up a fairly small percentage of purchases made ($230.87 of $2,379.77; 10.31%).</li>
    </ul>
